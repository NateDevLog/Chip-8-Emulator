# Chip-8-Emulator
Chip-8 emulator I wrote in rust using aquova's tutorial https://github.com/aquova/chip8-book.
I wrote this to introduce myself to rust and systems programming. 
I believe I learned a fair amount with this project, and would like to improve upon it at some point in the future.
This project does not currently have audio emulation functionality, but is something I would like to work on later. 
It shouldn't be necessary as i've included it as a bundle within the cargo.toml, but you may need to download sdl2 in order to run this properly.
